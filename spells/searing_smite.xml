Until the spell ends, at the start of each of its turns, the target must make a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 fire damage. The spell ends when the creature makes a successful saving throw against it. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each level above 1st.</readableeffect>
